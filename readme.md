# deep RL nanobot

This repository is for the following course

| university | professor | course | year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| University of GÃ¶ttingen | Prof. Dr. Reiner Kree | Advanced Topics in Biophysics / Physics of complex systems (Hard problems in soft matter) | 2019 |

I was awarded a grade of `1` (highest grade in the German system), [here is the transcript](./transcript%20University%20of%20Goettingen.pdf).

My responsibility was to create a [`stochastic fluid - nanobot` environment](./src/environment.py) using openAI gym.

My team member's responsibility was to create the [deep reinforcement learning agent](./src/DeepQ_CustomEnv_Test.py).

By working together we successfully trained the RL agent (nanobot) to navigate through the stochastic fluid environment to reach the target location. 

The purpose of this experiment is for applications in drug / gene delivery in the human body using nano-robots.

It was an exciting experience and Prof. Kree was absolutely an amazing teacher and a great physicist. He taught us about deep RL using concepts from advanced Physics that are not easily accessible by AI/ML people from other backgrounds.



I wish I had the chance to keep this project going but unfortunately I only spent less than 4 months in Germany as an exchange student. And I have been busy with my work in Singapore since then.
